Coding used for my dissertation

Birds is for analysing the bird data 
Butterfly is for the butterflies 
The two sets were compared throughout and in my final dissertation
Weather correlations is not as important but still was worth looking at 
Unfortunately I cannot upload the datasets due to their use in other work at the University of Exeter
